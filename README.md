`amms-rs` is a Rust library to interact with automated market makers across EVM chains.

This lib provides functionality to [discover](https://github.com/darkforestry/amms-rs/blob/main/examples/discover-factories.rs), [sync](https://github.com/darkforestry/amms-rs/blob/main/examples/sync-amms.rs), [filter](https://github.com/darkforestry/amms-rs/blob/main/examples/filter-value.rs), and interact with a variety of AMMs. This library also provides functionality to keep a [state space synced](https://github.com/darkforestry/amms-rs/blob/main/examples/state-space.rs), abstracting logic to handle chain reorgs, maintaining a state change cache and more.

`amms-rs` was built with modularity in mind, making it quick and easy to add a new `AMM` variant by implementing the `AutomatedMarketMaker` trait. For a full walkthrough on how to quickly implement a new `AMM`, check out [`addingAnAMM.md`](https://github.com/darkforestry/amms-rs/blob/main/docs/addingAnAMM.md).
